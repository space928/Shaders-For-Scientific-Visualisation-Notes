# 2023-10-24 Meeting Minutes
_S153, Sir Alwyn Williams Building at 14:00_  
_Sederunt: Thomas Mathieson, Dr. John Williamson_

## Last Week's Progress
- Thomas started the meeting with a demo showcasing recent progress on the project. He explained that each widget now spawns its own render process, which has been implemented nicely.
- Thomas switched to using JPEG streaming for better performance compared to PNG streaming.
- Basic mouse interaction, including mouse position tracking, has been implemented for the project.
- Thomas discussed latency testing, mentioning that there is a slight inconsistency in frame rates and latency, which he aims to investigate further; he found a latency of 2-4 frames on his desktop.
- He raised concerns about potential frame rate issues and bottlenecks, mentioning that the renderer appears to be running fast enough and GPU usage is low.
- The issue of orphaned canvases was highlighted, and the need to address this was discussed.
- The project was made available as a PyPi library for easy installation.
- Memory leaks were addressed, and the project is stable.

## Questions
- Thomas and John discussed the acceptable latency level for the project. Thomas expressed that there is room for improvement, especially on his laptop.
- They explored solutions for cleaning up orphaned canvases, considering options such as a global dictionary or a watchdog mechanism to kill processes that are no longer needed.
- John emphasized that achieving consistent latency and minimizing its variance is more important than reaching an exact frame-perfect latency.
- The idea of implementing a high-dimensional array transport system was introduced. John mentioned the importance of efficiently converting arrays for rendering in different contexts.
- They discussed the challenges and considerations related to multidimensional arrays and the need to support turning arrays into 2D textures.
- John advised that in the second semester, the project could focus on implementing more shader templates, improving the packaging and documentation, and creating a gallery of examples.

## Next Week's Plan
- Thomas plans to work on shader preprocessing, which will involve writing shader templates, implementing more built-in uniforms, and improving mouse support.
- He will also focus on addressing the issue of orphaned canvases and cleaning up unnecessary processes.

## Overall Schedule
- The overall plan for the project remains relatively unchanged, and it is progressing well.
