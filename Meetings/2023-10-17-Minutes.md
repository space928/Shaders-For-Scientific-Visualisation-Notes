# 2023-10-17 Meeting Minutes
_S153, Sir Alwyn Williams Building at 14:00_  
_Sederunt: Thomas Mathieson, Dr. John Williamson_

## Last Week's Progress
- Thomas discussed his decision to put H.264 encoding on hold in favor of more pressing tasks.
- He explored the challenges of implementing threading for OpenGL in separate processes to address Jupyter's asynchronous requirements.
- A diagram detailing the process structure for the SSV render widget and its interactions was presented.
- The render process architecture was discussed, involving client and server components with transmit and receive queues.
- Considerations regarding regular heartbeat messages for process synchronization were discussed.
- The possibility of using shared buffers and double buffering to share data was discussed briefly.
  - NumPy arrays have a simple ctypes array view which should be easy to share.
- Thomas mentioned exploring shader preprocessing using the Python preprocessing library (pcpp) which has good hooks for extending and overriding functionality.
- John expressed approval for this approach, highlighting its flexibility and control over shader code generation.

## Questions
- Discussion regarding multiple draw calls per frame:
  - The potential need for multiple draw calls was considered, which might complicate the system.
  - The importance of allowing multiple draw calls to different buffers was emphasized.
- Enabling user callbacks in the render process was discussed:
  - While it could have benefits, it was deemed risky due to potential threading issues.
- Concerns about latency testing, especially measuring input latency, were addressed:
  - The challenges of precise timestamping were acknowledged, and alternative methods like video frame analysis were suggested by John.

## Next Week's Plan
- Thomas plans to complete the implementation of the multiprocess architecture.
- He intends to work on latency testing and mouse/keyboard interactivity.
- Shader preprocessing will continue to be explored.

## Overall schedule
- Progress was noted as positive, and December was identified as a reasonable timeline for a functional prototype which can take NumPy data, get it into a shader, and render it.

_Meeting adjourned at 14:25_
